Sending and Receiving MTOM-encoded binary data
PeopleSoft supports the MTOM protocol for sending and receiving binary data using service operations. 
While you can send and receive binary data using SOAP, doing so requires that you Base64-encode the data, which can increase message size by 33 percent or more. 
The MTOM protocol enables you to send and receive binary data in its original binary form, without any increase in size due to encoding.
For sending or receiving MTOM-encoded binary data, we have to use message segments to store the data. 
The SegmentContentType property of the message object is used to set or read the content type of each message segment.


On the weblogic webserver, in the integrationGateway.properties file enable the MTOM Listening Connectors. 
ig.MTOM.enablePeopleSoftServiceListeningConnector=true
ig.MTOM.enableHttpListeningConnector=true

Bounce the webserver after making this change.
